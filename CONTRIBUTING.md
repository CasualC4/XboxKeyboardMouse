## Installer Updates
Contributors do not need to worry about Installer updates.
(The ClickOnce user installations auto-update to match the targeted files in the master "Installer" folder area, based on the application manifest there. These get published to the Installer folder through the Visual Studio "Publish" function, which should be performed and committed by either the repository owner or a trusted collaborator, after merging user-facing upgrades.)
